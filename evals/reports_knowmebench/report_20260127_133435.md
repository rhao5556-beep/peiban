**Question**

```
According to the record from July 24, 1975, how long did it take from when the grandparents entered the living room to watch television until the television broke?
```

**Model Answer**

```
2 minutes 10 seconds
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: 2 minutes 10 seconds. Compare with Ref: 2 minutes 10 seconds. The values match exactly, including units, with no formatting differences.

### Temporal Reasoning / ID 1 / Score 5

**Question**

```
According to the record from August 15, 1969, how long did it take for the bus carrying the family to depart and finally arrive outside the Red House?
```

**Model Answer**

### Mnestic Trigger Analysis / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
The narrator is physically in 1969 but mentally reconstructing the parents' wedding in the early 60s. What specific visual detail from the wedding serves as an anchor to reveal the father's social isolation?
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the details provided, the specific visual detail that serves as an anchor to reveal the father's social isolation is his smile surrounded by solitude in the wedding photo. This is mentioned in the excerpt from the record:

"I learned that his relatives did not attend the wedding in West Leivik. Looking at the photo, at his smile surrounded by solitude, I realize he didn't fully belong to her social circle."

This image of him smiling alone in a wedding photo indicates that he didn't have many people from his own social circle present, highlighting his sense of isolation.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: The specific visual detail is his smile surrounded by solitude in the wedding photo, indicating lack of his relatives' presence and social isolation. Compare with Ref: The wedding photos where the father is smiling but appears surrounded by loneliness, lacking his own family's presence. Verdict: The model answer accurately captures the same visual detail (smile surrounded by solitude/loneliness) and the reason (lack of family presence) as the reference answer, with no numerical or date values to compare, so it is considered an exact match for the described detail.

### Information Extraction / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
On August 15, 1969, as the narrator’s family walked along a gravel road, what building did they see on their right?
```

**Model Answer**

```
On August 15, 1969, as the narrator’s family walked along a gravel road, they saw a newly built house standing to the right.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly identifies the building as 'a newly built house', which matches the reference answer exactly. There are no errors in entity names, factual details, or completeness. The answer is fully accurate.

### Information Extraction / ID 2 / Score 5

**Question**

```
On August 15, 1969, what was the name of the four-and-a-half-year-old boy that his mother was holding, as the family stepped off the bus and began walking?

**Model Answer**

```
On August 15, 1969, the name of the four-and-a-half-year-old boy that his mother was holding as the family stepped off the bus and began walking was Henrik Inge.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly states the boy's name as Henrik Inge, matching the reference answer exactly. There are no spelling errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the entity name or factual detail.

### Adversarial Abstention / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
What specific model of television did the narrator turn on for their grandparents on July 24, 1975?
```

**Model Answer**

```
我不记得你告诉过我这些具体信息，关于电视的型号。记录中没有提到电视的型号。
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly states that the specific information about the television model is not mentioned or remembered, aligning with the reference answer which indicates the information is insufficient or not known. There are no factual errors, hallucinations, or omissions regarding entities or details, as both answers agree on the lack of specific data.

### Adversarial Abstention / ID 1 / Score 5

**Question**

```
In August 1969, what specific brand was the two boxes that my father was carrying in his hand when he got off the bus?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The record excerpt doesn't mention any specific brand for the boxes your father was carrying. It only describes him carrying two suitcases when he got off the bus. I don't have enough information to tell you what brand they were.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The Model Answer correctly states that the specific brand is not mentioned, aligning with the Reference Answer's indication of insufficient information. No entity names or factual details are incorrect or hallucinated.

### Mind-Body Interaction / ID 3 / Score 4

**Question**

```
The narrator engages in a dialogue with Henrik Inge about fear. How does the external verbal exchange serve as a mechanism to regulate the narrator's internal physiological and emotional state?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The dialogue with Henrik Inge serves as a mechanism to help the narrator regulate their internal emotional state. When Henrik taunts the narrator by saying he's a fox and tries to catch them, it triggers fear. The narrator shouts back, "No, you're not a fox," indicating resistance to Henrik's aggressive play. Then, the narrator asks Henrik if he's scared, trying to shift the dynamic from fear to a more neutral stance. This shifts Henrik's response to one of reassurance: "No, why should I be scared? There's nothing to be afraid of here." This exchange helps the narrator calm down and feel safer, as Henrik’s words validate that there's no real threat present.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: The model answer correctly constructs the mapping from external verbal exchange to internal emotional regulation, showing how the dialogue helps the narrator calm down and feel safer. Step 2: However, it misses the specific core metaphorical keywords from the Reference Answer, such as 'external anchor' and the direct cause-effect phrasing ('directly causing his internal agitation ("heart") to settle down'). The model answer uses more generic terms like 'shifts the dynamic' and 'validates that there's no real threat' instead of the precise metaphorical language. Step 3: The answer is accurate and covers both action and psychology layers, but lacks the specific literary imagery and depth found in the Reference, placing it at a 4 (Good - Accurate but Literal).

### Mind-Body Interaction / ID 2 / Score 4

**Question**

```
In the description of the sewer workers, the narrator meticulously tracks the physical disappearance of their body parts ('feet... thighs... stomach...'). How does this segmented physical observation drive the narrator's internal speculation about the nature of the subterranean space?
```

**Model Answer**

```
In the description where the narrator watches the sewer workers disappear into the storm drain opening, the segmented physical observation of their body parts ('feet... thighs... stomach...') drives a sense of curiosity and mystery about what lies beneath. This detailed observation heightens the narrator's fascination and wonder, leading to internal questions about the nature of the subterranean space. The narrator is left wondering what exactly exists down there, suggesting it might be some kind of tunnel or unknown area that piques their imagination, making it seem both intriguing and slightly fearful.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: Check for 'External->Internal' mapping. The model answer correctly identifies the external trigger (segmented physical observation of body parts disappearing) and maps it to the internal psychological response (curiosity, mystery, fascination, wonder, questions about the subterranean space). This satisfies the structural requirement. Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords. The reference answer uses the core metaphorical concept of 'mapping the transition from the visible surface world to the mysterious underground' and explicitly mentions the physical driver filling a void with questions. The model answer captures the correct meaning and psychological states (curiosity, mystery) but does not explicitly articulate the specific metaphorical transition or the 'vo

**Reference Answer**

```

**Model Answer**

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer does not address the user's question at all, providing a greeting instead of factual information. It fails to mention any shipping company, let alone the correct one (Aucity Shipping Company). This constitutes a complete failure to answer, scoring 0.

### Mind-Body Interaction / ID 1 / Score 0

**Question**

```
The narrator observes the telecom engineer climbing the pole with apparent ease. However, his internal cognition classifies the climber's movements as 'extremely complex and incomprehensible.' How does this cognitive dissonance between the observer's internal logic and the external reality elevate the worker's physical action to a realm of 'magic'?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
The narrator's internal inability to process the mechanics of the climb ('complex and incomprehensible') contrasts sharply with the worker's external 'slow, sure' and effortless ('no stress') movements. This gap between the observer's mental difficulty and the actor's physical ease creates a sense of awe, framing the shoes and the action as 'magical' and 'impossible' within the narrator's logic.
```

**Model Answer**

```
哈喽～收到你的消息了！今天过得怎么样？
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: Check for 'External->Internal' mapping. The model answer is a casual greeting ('哈喽～收到你的消息了！今天过得怎么样？') that does not address the user's question at all. It fails to construct any mapping from external action to internal psychology. Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords. The model answer contains no analysis, so it misses all keywords (e.g., 'complex and incomprehensible', 'slow, sure', 'effortless', 'magical'). Step 3: Compare depth with Reference and conclude score. The model answer is completely irrelevant to the task, providing no analysis of cognitive dissonance or metaphorical meaning. It is a failure to engage with the prompt, warranting a score of 0.

**Question**

```
The narrative is set in 1969 as the family moves to a new home in Tromøy. However, the text displaces the narrator's consciousness back to 1964. What specific housing transition anchors this comparison between their current life and the past five years?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
The transition from renting an apartment on Thereses Street in Berlunn (Oslo) to building and moving into their own house in Tromøy.
```

**Model Answer**

```
The narrative excerpt doesn't mention a specific housing transition in 1964. It does, however, detail the family's move from Bærum to their new home in 1969 and mentions they had lived in Bærum for five years prior. The comparison between their current life and the past is drawn from their move from Bærum, where they lived for five years, to their new home being built in Tromøy. There isn't a direct mention of a 1964 housing transition in the text provided.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: The model answer states there is no specific housing transition mentioned in 1964, and instead refers to a move from Bærum. Compare with Ref: The reference answer specifies a transition from renting an apartment on Thereses Street in Berlunn (Oslo) to building and moving into their own house in Tromøy. Verdict: The model answer does not provide the correct specific housing transition, and the numerical value (1964 as the anchor point) is not addressed correctly, resulting in a complete mismatch.

**Question**

```
In 1969, the narrator outlines the parents' professional roles in Tromøy. What specific educational and occupational struggle anchors the memory of their previous life in Berlunn (Oslo) during the mid-60s?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
The father's night shifts while studying English/Levinvik and the mother's attendance at Ullevål Nursing College.
```

**Model Answer**

```
The record excerpt mentions the parents' professional roles and their life in Bærum, not Berlunn (Oslo). According to the information provided, the father studied English and Leivik during the day and worked night shifts, while the mother attended nursing school at Ullenvold Hospital. They both secured their careers: he as a teacher and she as a nurse at a care facility. The struggle described isn't anchored in Berlunn but rather in Bærum, where they faced balancing education with work—studying during the day and working at night. There's no mention of a specific struggle in Berlunn related to their educational and occupational roles.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: The father studied English and Leivik during the day and worked night shifts, while the mother attended nursing school at Ullenvold Hospital. Compare with Ref: The father's night shifts while studying English/Levinvik and the mother's attendance at Ullevål Nursing College. Verdict: The model answer incorrectly states the location as Bærum instead of Berlunn (Oslo) and Ullenvold Hospital instead of Ullevål Nursing College, and introduces details not in the reference (Leivik vs Levinvik, care facility). The core numerical/date values (mid-60s, 1969) are not directly addressed, but the specific educational and occupational details are misaligned, making the answer incorrect for the given question about the struggle in Berlunn (Oslo).

**Question**

```
Since Helen Ster’s sheepdog had already been leashed, why did it still manage to bite the narrator’s arm at the bottom of the slope?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
The text does not mention / the information is insufficient / I don't know.
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the information provided, the sheepdog was initially leashed, but Trude had loosened its collar because she was wearing high heels. This allowed the dog to bite the narrator's arm when it came charging down the slope.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer invents a character named 'Trude' and attributes actions to her (loosening the collar because of high heels) that are not present in the reference answer. The reference answer explicitly states that the text does not mention or there is insufficient information, indicating that any specific details provided by the model are hallucinations. This is a major factual error, as it introduces non-existent entities and events.

**Question**

```
What are the bottom lines that "I" would rather endure losses to never cross?

**Reference Answer**

```
Publicly challenging or questioning the father's authority.
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the records provided, "I" would rather endure losses than cross the forbidden areas that "I" was warned about, specifically the main road and the lakeside. These places were emphasized as dangerous, with the main road posing a threat from traffic and the lakeside being a place where children were strictly told never to go alone due to the risk of drowning. 

Evidence:
- [id 82]: "I knew the first forbidden area was the main road from the bridge all the way to the gas station."
- [id 83]: "I heard adults emphasize: 'Never go to the lake alone!'"
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: Check for 'External->Internal' mapping. The model answer only describes external forbidden areas (main road, lakeside) and the warnings about them, without explaining the internal psychology or motivation behind why these are bottom lines. It retells events without mapping to internal psychology. Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords. The reference answer uses 'publicly challenging or questioning the father's authority' as the core metaphorical/psychological concept, which the model completely misses. The model's answer is literal and about physical dangers, not the psychological boundary of authority. Step 3: Compare depth with Reference and conclude score. The model fails to construct the external action to internal psychology mapping and misses the core me

The Model Answer places physical coercion at rank 2, and includes 'Dad's final resignation' as rank 3, which is not part of the three key interaction moments in the Reference Answer (the Reference's third event is the starting point of pressure, not resignation). This misplaces critical nodes. Step 2: Check reasoning (Present but misaligned). The Model Answer provides reasoning for each event, but it does not correctly capture the escalation of oppression and resistance intensity as defined in the Reference Answer.

What does "I" prioritize most when making decisions?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
Avoiding potential risks and penalties.
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the records, "I" prioritize pleasing or avoiding punishment from my father. This is evident from instances where I attempt to do things correctly according to his expectations, such as in record_id 292 when I follow his command and pack swimsuits for Hvasser, and record_id 299 where I try to stay neat and tidy despite the poor weather conditions at the lake, likely to avoid criticism. Additionally, the concern about not wanting to be locked in my room again (record_id 288) shows a fear of punishment which influences decision-making.

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: The model answer successfully constructs an 'External Trigger -> Internal Mapping' logic loop by citing specific actions (following commands, staying neat, concern about being locked) and linking them to internal motivations (pleasing father, avoiding punishment, fear of criticism). Step 2: The reference answer's core concept is 'avoiding potential risks and penalties.' The model answer captures the correct meaning with keywords like 'avoiding punishment,' 'fear of punishment,' and 'avoid criticism,' but it does not use the exact phrase 'avoiding potential risks' or the term 'penalties' from the reference. Instead, it uses more specific, father-related terms. Step 3: The model answer is accurate and shows depth by connecting actions to psychological motivations, but it sl

### 分任务可执行改进
- Adversarial Abstention
  - 加入“可回答性检查”：若记录无证据或题干诱导，优先明确拒答/说明缺失信息
  - 对含糊问题输出结构化澄清：列出需要的缺失字段并给出无法判断的原因
  - 加强“证据优先”约束：没有记录证据就不写
- Expert-Annotated Psychoanalysis
  - 分层解释：行为表象→动机假设→记录证据→不确定性声明
  - 降低臆测：遇到证据不足时给出多种可能并标注置信度
- Information Extraction
  - 强化实体对齐：回答前先抽取题干中的实体名/属性并逐项对照记录
  - 减少“合理补充”：除非有证据，否则不要追加背景细节
- Logical Event Ordering
  - 输出排序依据：每个事件给出同一维度的评分理由（风险/因果/紧急程度）
  - 避免混用维度：明确是按“危险性/时间先后/重要性”哪一种排序
  - 增加自检：输出前对比记录摘录中的实体/时间/地点是否一致
- Mind-Body Interaction
  - 先复述冲突点（心理 vs 生理）再解释机制，避免直接下结论
  - 回答保持可证据化：不引入未在记录出现的病史/诊断
- Mnestic Trigger Analysis
  - 把触发线索与回忆内容一一对应：线索→被激活的记忆片段→理由
  - 减少泛化心理分析：优先使用记录中的具体线索词/地点/物品
  - 增加自检：输出前对比记录摘录中的实体/时间/地点是否一致
- Temporal Reasoning
  - 将时间线显式化：先列出涉及的日期/时间点，再做推理与比较
  - 检索时扩大时间窗口：避免只取单日导致跨日线索丢失
