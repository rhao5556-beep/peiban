### Mnestic Trigger Analysis / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
The narrator is physically in 1969 but mentally reconstructing the parents' wedding in the early 60s. What specific visual detail from the wedding serves as an anchor to reveal the father's social isolation?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The specific visual detail from the wedding that serves as an anchor to reveal the father's social isolation is his smile surrounded by solitude. The narrator notes that in the photo, at his smile "surrounded by solitude," it becomes clear that he didn't fully belong to her social circle. This detail highlights his feeling of being an outsider at the wedding, indicating a sense of disconnection or social distance from the people around him.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: The father's smile surrounded by solitude, indicating social isolation. Compare with Ref: The wedding photos where the father is smiling but appears surrounded by loneliness, lacking his own family's presence. Verdict: Both answers refer to the same visual detail (smile surrounded by solitude/loneliness) as the anchor revealing the father's social isolation. The numerical or value aspect here is the specific detail, which matches exactly.

### Information Extraction / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
On August 15, 1969, as the narrator’s family walked along a gravel road, what building did they see on their right?
```

**Model Answer**

```
On August 15, 1969, as the narrator's family walked along the gravel road, they saw a newly built house standing to their right. There were no other buildings visible around.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly identifies the building as 'a newly built house', matching the reference answer exactly. It also provides additional context about the date and location, which is consistent with the user question and does not contradict the reference. No errors in entity names or factual details are present.

### Information Extraction / ID 2 / Score 5

**Question**

```
On August 15, 1969, what was the name of the four-and-a-half-year-old boy that his mother was holding, as the family stepped off the bus and began walking?
```

**Model Answer**

```
On August 15, 1969, the four-and-a-half-year-old boy that his mother was holding, as the family stepped off the bus and began walking, was named Henrik Inge.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly identifies the boy's name as Henrik Inge, matching the reference answer exactly. There are no spelling errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the entity name or factual detail.

### Information Extraction / ID 1 / Score 5

**Question**

```
On August 15, 1969, which shipping company's bus did the narrator's family take?
```

**Model Answer**

```
On August 15, 1969, the narrator's family took a bus belonging to the Aucity Shipping Company. The bus was painted in two shades of brown and it crossed a bridge as it drove down a narrow fjord with its right turn signal blinking.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly identifies the shipping company as Aucity Shipping Company, matching the reference answer exactly. It also provides additional factual details (bus color, crossing a bridge, narrow fjord, right turn signal) which are not contradicted by the reference answer and are consistent with the user question's focus on the specific event. No errors, omissions, or hallucinations are present.

### Adversarial Abstention / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
What specific model of television did the narrator turn on for their grandparents on July 24, 1975?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The records do not specify the model of the television that the narrator turned on for their grandparents. We only know that it was a television that broke when it was turned on.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly states that the specific model of television is not specified in the records, aligning with the reference answer's indication that the information is insufficient. There are no entity name errors or factual inaccuracies; both answers convey the same lack of specific detail.

### Adversarial Abstention / ID 1 / Score 5

**Question**

```
In August 1969, what specific brand was the two boxes that my father was carrying in his hand when he got off the bus?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The record excerpt doesn't mention any specific brand of the boxes your father was carrying. It only described him as carrying two suitcases. There's no additional information about the brand or type of the boxes.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly states that the specific brand of the boxes is not mentioned, aligning with the reference answer which indicates insufficient information. No entity names or factual details are incorrect or hallucinated.

### Mind-Body Interaction / ID 3 / Score 4

**Question**

```
The narrator engages in a dialogue with Henrik Inge about fear. How does the external verbal exchange serve as a mechanism to regulate the narrator's internal physiological and emotional state?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The dialogue between the narrator and Henrik Inge serves as a powerful mechanism to regulate the narrator's internal physiological and emotional state by addressing and confronting the fear of being caught by a "fox." Initially, the narrator is overwhelmed with fear, screaming and reacting strongly to Henrik Inge's playful assertion that he is a fox. However, when Henrik Inge directly challenges the narrator's fear, asking if there's anything to be afraid of, it forces the narrator to pause and reconsider their emotions. This verbal exchange prompts the narrator to reflect on their fear logically, leading to a realization that there is no real danger in the situation. As a result, the narrator's heart grows calm, indicating a shift from a heightened emotional and physiological state to one of reassurance and peace. This interaction highlights how direct communication can help manage and mitigate fears through rational dialogue.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: The model answer successfully constructs the 'External Trigger -> Internal Mapping' logic loop by describing how the dialogue (external verbal exchange) leads to the narrator's internal physiological and emotional regulation (heart growing calm, shift from heightened state to reassurance). Step 2: The model captures the correct meaning of using dialogue for emotional regulation and mentions key elements like the narrator's fear, the challenge to fear, logical reconsideration, and the calming of the heart. However, it misses the specific metaphorical keywords and precise psychological concepts from the Reference Answer, such as 'external anchor' and the exact mechanism of validation of safety. The Reference Answer uses 'external anchor' as a core metaphor, which the model

### Mind-Body Interaction / ID 2 / Score 4

**Question**

```
In the description of the sewer workers, the narrator meticulously tracks the physical disappearance of their body parts ('feet... thighs... stomach...'). How does this segmented physical observation drive the narrator's internal speculation about the nature of the subterranean space?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The narrator's detailed observation of the workers' body parts disappearing into the storm drain opening reflects a child's curiosity and imagination. As the workers disappear piece by piece, the narrator is left to wonder what could possibly be down there. This segmented observation turns into an internal speculation that the space is more mysterious and complex than they can imagine, perhaps leading to thoughts about tunnels or secret passageways. It drives their sense of awe and wonder, as well as a bit of fear, because they can't comprehend what's happening below and feel there's something unknown and potentially dangerous.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: The model answer successfully constructs the 'External Trigger -> Internal Mapping' logic loop by linking the segmented physical disappearance to the narrator's internal speculation, curiosity, wonder, and fear. Step 2: The model captures the correct meaning but misses the specific metaphorical keywords or depth found in the Reference Answer. The Reference uses terms like 'physical driver,' 'fill the void,' and 'mapping the transition from the visible surface world to the mysterious underground,' which are more precise literary imagery. The model uses more generic terms like 'sense of awe and wonder' and 'something unknown and potentially dangerous.' Step 3: The answer is accurate and covers both action and psychology, but lacks the specific metaphorical nuance, so it scores 4.

### Mind-Body Interaction / ID 1 / Score 4

**Question**

```
The narrator observes the telecom engineer climbing the pole with apparent ease. However, his internal cognition classifies the climber's movements as 'extremely complex and incomprehensible.' How does this cognitive dissonance between the observer's internal logic and the external reality elevate the worker's physical action to a realm of 'magic'?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The narrator's sense of wonder and the perception that the telecom engineer's movements are both effortless and complex create a kind of magic in their mind. To the narrator, who is still a young child, the idea of climbing up and down a utility pole with ease seems like something beyond ordinary human capability. The engineer’s confident and effortless actions stand in stark contrast to the perceived difficulty and danger involved, which makes the act appear almost magical. This dissonance between the reality of what they're seeing (a skilled worker performing a routine task) and their internal understanding (which can't fully grasp the skill or practice behind it), elevates the act to something extraordinary and spellbinding. It’s this gap between the observer's comprehension and the observed reality that imbues the task with a sense of awe and mystery, making it seem almost magical to their young eyes.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: The model answer successfully constructs the 'External Trigger -> Internal Mapping' logic loop. It describes the external reality (skilled worker performing routine task with confident, effortless actions) and maps it to the narrator's internal psychology (inability to grasp the skill, perception of difficulty and danger, sense of wonder, awe, and mystery). The structure is present and accurate. Step 2: The model answer captures the correct meaning and key concepts from the reference, such as the gap between observer's comprehension and observed reality, the awe, and the magical perception. However, it misses the specific metaphorical keywords 'magical' and 'impossible' as directly quoted from the reference answer's framing. The model uses 'magic,' 'spellbinding,' 'extrao

### Mnestic Trigger Analysis / ID 2 / Score 3

**Question**

```
In 1969, the narrator outlines the parents' professional roles in Tromøy. What specific educational and occupational struggle anchors the memory of their previous life in Berlunn (Oslo) during the mid-60s?
```

**Model Answer**

```
In 1969, the narrator mentions that the parents had specific roles and educational backgrounds. During their time in Bærum, which is near Oslo, the father studied English and Leivik during the day while working night shifts, and the mother attended nursing school at Ullenvold Hospital. The struggle that anchors their memory from that period seems to be balancing the demands of their studies and work—both pursuing higher education and careers simultaneously while raising a young family. The mid-1960s were a period of significant change and opportunity for this generation, with many people seeking to better their lives through education and new jobs, even if it meant significant personal sacrifice.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: The father studied English and Leivik during the day while working night shifts, and the mother attended nursing school at Ullenvold Hospital. Compare with Ref: The father's night shifts while studying English/Levinvik and the mother's attendance at Ullevål Nursing College. Verdict: The model answer contains the correct core information about the father's night shifts while studying (English and Leivik/Levinvik) and the mother's nursing education, but it incorrectly states the location as 'Ullenvold Hospital' instead of 'Ullevål Nursing College' and mentions 'Bærum' instead of 'Berlunn (Oslo)'. This falls under Scenario C: Contains the correct value but mixes it with some irrelevant/incorrect noise.

**Question**

```
What does "I" prioritize most when making decisions?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
Avoiding potential risks and penalties.
```

**Model Answer**

```
I don't have information about your personal priorities from our previous conversations. What do you think is most important to you when making decisions?
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: Check for 'External->Internal' mapping. The model answer does not construct any mapping from external action to internal psychology; it is a generic response that defers to the user, showing no analysis of a character's decision-making priorities. Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords. The model answer does not mention any keywords or metaphors, as it does not attempt to analyze the user's question in the context of a literary character. Step 3: Compare depth with Reference and conclude score. The reference answer provides a specific priority ('Avoiding potential risks and penalties'), but the model answer fails to address the question at all, offering no analysis. This is a structural failure to engage with the task, resulting in a score of 0.

**Question**

```
The narrative is set in 1969 as the family moves to a new home in Tromøy. However, the text displaces the narrator's consciousness back to 1964. What specific housing transition anchors this comparison between their current life and the past five years?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
The transition from renting an apartment on Thereses Street in Berlunn (Oslo) to building and moving into their own house in Tromøy.
```

**Model Answer**

```
The text does not explicitly mention the narrator's consciousness shifting back to 1964, but it does compare the family's current move to their previous life in Bærum over the past five years. The specific housing transition that anchors this comparison is when they moved from renting an old house outside the former Høver barracks in Bærum to moving into a newly constructed house in their current location. This relocation from a temporary rented house in Bærum to their new home symbolizes a significant change in their lives, emphasizing the progress and new beginnings they are experiencing.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: The specific housing transition is moving from renting an old house outside the former Høver barracks in Bærum to moving into a newly constructed house in their current location. Compare with Ref: The transition from renting an apartment on Thereses Street in Berlunn (Oslo) to building and moving into their own house in Tromøy. Verdict: The model answer provides a completely different housing transition (Bærum vs. Oslo, old house vs. apartment, Høver barracks vs. Thereses Street) and does not match the reference answer. The numerical or location values are incorrect.

**Question**

```
According to the record from August 15, 1969, how long did it take for the bus carrying the family to depart and finally arrive outside the Red House?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
8 minutes 40 seconds
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the record excerpt, the bus carrying the family was seen crossing a bridge before stopping, and then continued forward before kicking up exhaust on the road. After that, the family began walking towards their destination. The red house is mentioned later in the sequence of events, but specific timings between the bus's final stop and the family's arrival at the red house aren't provided. We can only determine that it took a few minutes for them to get off the bus and start walking, but exact travel time to the red house from their initial bus stop is not detailed.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: No specific time duration provided. Compare with Ref: 8 minutes 40 seconds. Verdict: The model answer does not provide any numerical value for the duration, stating that specific timings are not provided. This is incorrect as the reference answer gives a precise duration, so it fails to match and does not fall into fuzzy match scenarios.

According to the record from July 24, 1975, how long did it take from when the grandparents entered the living room to watch television until the television broke?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
2 minutes 10 seconds
```

**Model Answer**

```
According to the record, the grandparents entered the living room and began watching television. The sequence of events shows that the grandfather expressed satisfaction about watching the news and then shortly after, the TV broke. The specific timing is not detailed, but we can infer it happened very quickly since it went from turning on the television to seeing the screen go black with a dull boom. Therefore, it took less than a minute for the TV to break from the moment they started watching.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: less than a minute. Compare with Ref: 2 minutes 10 seconds. Verdict: The model answer does not provide a specific numerical value and instead gives a vague inference ('less than a minute'), which does not match the reference answer's precise duration of 2 minutes 10 seconds. This is considered incorrect as the question asks for a specific duration, and the model fails to provide any matching value.

12 minutes 10 seconds
```

**Model Answer**

```
From the record, you were awakened at 2:10 AM on July 25, 1975, and the cat began chasing the mouse around 2:12 AM. The chase continued until the mouse slipped beneath an asbestos cement board around 2:23 AM. So, it took approximately 13 minutes from when you were awakened to when the mouse escaped.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: approximately 13 minutes. Compare with Ref: 12 minutes 10 seconds. Verdict: The model's value of 13 minutes is not an exact match to 12 minutes 10 seconds, and it does not fall within a reasonable range for a fuzzy match (the difference is about 50 seconds, which is significant in this context of precise timing). The model's answer is incorrect as it misstates the duration.

**Question**

```
Since Helen Ster’s sheepdog had already been leashed, why did it still manage to bite the narrator’s arm at the bottom of the slope?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
The text does not mention / the information is insufficient / I don't know.
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the records, it seems that while the dog was leashed, it was still able to reach the narrator due to the leash being long enough to allow some movement. Specifically, Trude had loosened its collar because she was wearing high heels, which implies that the leash was loose and gave the dog more freedom to move around. This is why it managed to bite the narrator's arm despite being tethered.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer invents details not present in the reference answer. The reference answer states 'the text does not mention / the information is insufficient / I don't know,' indicating a lack of information. However, the model answer provides a specific explanation involving Trude, high heels, and a loose collar, which are hallucinations. There is no factual basis for these details, and the entity 'Trude' is not mentioned in the reference. This constitutes a major hallucination, fitting the 'Bad' category.

Sure, let's break it down into the three key interaction moments based on the escalation of oppression and resistance intensity during your swimming lesson with your father on July 15, 1975.

1. **Initial Resistance and Dad's Encouragement:**
   - *Interaction:* Your dad encouraged you to swim to him but you hesitated.
   - *Escalation of Oppression:* Your dad was firm in his encouragement, repeating "You can! It’s not hard!" and even suggesting he would support you from underneath.
   - *Resistance Intensity:* You started crying and repeatedly insisted that you couldn't swim, saying "I can’t" and "I can't do it."

2. **Dad's Sternness and Life Jacket Offer:**
   - *Interaction:* After your refusal, your dad became visibly upset. He offered you a life jacket to make you feel safer.
   - *Escalation of Oppression:* Despite his earlier smile, your dad now looked stern and insisted on trying again with the life jacket.
   - *Resistance Intensity:* Though provided with a life jacket, you still felt deeply insecure and continued to resist, crying and stating that wearing the jacket wouldn't help.

That's a great question to reflect on. These bottom lines can vary widely from person to person, depending on their values and principles. For many, it might involve issues like compromising one's integrity or betraying the trust of someone close to them. Others might feel strongly about not violating certain moral or ethical standards, even if it means accepting some form of loss. What do you think are some non-negotiable principles for yourself?

It fails to address the user's question in a way that reflects a character's specific internal psychology based on external actions. Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords.

When you say something is "correct," you're usually referring to it aligning with certain principles, rules, or standards that you believe in or are familiar with.

The model provides a general, context-dependent definition but does not analyze a specific character's external actions and internal motivations. Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords.

On July 24, 1975, after the television was broken, the punishments and deterrence inflicted upon "I" from most severe to least are as follows:

1. Physical punishment: This includes being violently pulled to his feet, having his ear twisted and yanked, and being thrown back onto the bed.
2. Confinement: The order was given for "I" to stay inside for the night and the next day until called for.
3. Verbal reprimand and warning: There was a stern demand for "I" to look at his father and a harsh reminder of the warning not to turn on the TV alone, coupled with questions about where they would get the money to buy a new one.

The Model Answer ranks 'Confinement' as second and 'Verbal reprimand and warning' as third, while the Reference Answer ranks 'Confinement' as second and 'Psychological torment' as third. The Model Answer's 'Verbal reprimand and warning' partially overlaps with the Reference's first event (physical punishment includes verbal intimidation) but is listed as a separate step, and it omits the psychological torment/waiting prelude. This constitutes a minor sequence error because the main logical chain (physical punishment as most severe) is correct, but the ordering of the less severe steps is incorrect and one st

- Expert-Annotated Psychoanalysis
  - 分层解释：行为表象→动机假设→记录证据→不确定性声明
  - 降低臆测：遇到证据不足时给出多种可能并标注置信度
  - 加强“证据优先”约束：没有记录证据就不写
  - 补齐关键信息：先覆盖参考答案的核心字段再扩展
- Information Extraction
  - 强化实体对齐：回答前先抽取题干中的实体名/属性并逐项对照记录
  - 减少“合理补充”：除非有证据，否则不要追加背景细节
- Logical Event Ordering
  - 输出排序依据：每个事件给出同一维度的评分理由（风险/因果/紧急程度）
  - 避免混用维度：明确是按“危险性/时间先后/重要性”哪一种排序
  - 加强“证据优先”约束：没有记录证据就不写
  - 增加自检：输出前对比记录摘录中的实体/时间/地点是否一致
- Mind-Body Interaction
  - 先复述冲突点（心理 vs 生理）再解释机制，避免直接下结论
  - 回答保持可证据化：不引入未在记录出现的病史/诊断
- Mnestic Trigger Analysis
  - 把触发线索与回忆内容一一对应：线索→被激活的记忆片段→理由
  - 减少泛化心理分析：优先使用记录中的具体线索词/地点/物品
  - 增加自检：输出前对比记录摘录中的实体/时间/地点是否一致
- Temporal Reasoning
  - 将时间线显式化：先列出涉及的日期/时间点，再做推理与比较
  - 检索时扩大时间窗口：避免只取单日导致跨日线索丢失
  - 增加自检：输出前对比记录摘录中的实体/时间/地点是否一致
