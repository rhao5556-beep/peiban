## 答得最好的样例（Top）

### Temporal Reasoning / ID 3 / Score 0

**Question**

```
According to the record from the early morning of July 25, 1975, how long did it take from when "I" was awakened to when I saw the cat chasing the mouse and eventually the mouse escaping?
```

**Model Answer**

```
8 minutes 10 seconds
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: 8 minutes 10 seconds. Compare with Ref: 12 minutes 10 seconds. The model answer is completely different from the reference answer, with no overlap or reasonable error range, so it is incorrect.

### Temporal Reasoning / ID 2 / Score 0

**Question**

```
According to the record from July 24, 1975, how long did it take from when the grandparents entered the living room to watch television until the television broke?
```

**Model Answer**

```
1 minute 10 seconds
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: 1 minute 10 seconds. Compare with Ref: 2 minutes 10 seconds. The model answer is off by exactly 1 minute, which is a significant error in duration and not within a reasonable range for a fuzzy match. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Temporal Reasoning / ID 1 / Score 0

**Question**

```
According to the record from August 15, 1969, how long did it take for the bus carrying the family to depart and finally arrive outside the Red House?
```

**Model Answer**

```
7 minutes 0 seconds
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: 7 minutes 0 seconds. Compare with Ref: 8 minutes 40 seconds. The model answer is completely different from the reference answer, with a discrepancy of 1 minute 40 seconds. This does not fall within a reasonable range for a fuzzy match, as the context likely expects a precise duration. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### 分任务可执行改进
- Temporal Reasoning
  - 将时间线显式化：先列出涉及的日期/时间点，再做推理与比较
  - 检索时扩大时间窗口：避免只取单日导致跨日线索丢失
  - 增加自检：输出前对比记录摘录中的实体/时间/地点是否一致
