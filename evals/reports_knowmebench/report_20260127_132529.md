### Mnestic Trigger Analysis / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
The narrator is physically in 1969 but mentally reconstructing the parents' wedding in the early 60s. What specific visual detail from the wedding serves as an anchor to reveal the father's social isolation?
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the details provided, the specific visual detail that serves as an anchor to reveal the father's social isolation is his smile surrounded by solitude in the wedding photo. This is mentioned in the excerpt from the record:

"I learned that his relatives did not attend the wedding in West Leivik. Looking at the photo, at his smile surrounded by solitude, I realize he didn't fully belong to her social circle."

This image of him smiling alone in a wedding photo indicates that he didn't have many people from his own social circle present, highlighting his sense of isolation.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: The specific visual detail is his smile surrounded by solitude in the wedding photo, indicating lack of his relatives' presence and social isolation. Compare with Ref: The wedding photos where the father is smiling but appears surrounded by loneliness, lacking his own family's presence. Verdict: The model answer accurately captures the same visual detail (smile surrounded by solitude/loneliness) and the reason (lack of family presence) as the reference answer, with no numerical or date discrepancies to evaluate; the core descriptive detail matches exactly.

### Information Extraction / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
On August 15, 1969, as the narrator’s family walked along a gravel road, what building did they see on their right?
```

**Model Answer**

```
On August 15, 1969, as the narrator’s family walked along a gravel road, they saw a newly built house standing to the right.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly identifies the building as 'a newly built house', which matches the reference answer exactly. All entity names and factual details are accurate, with no errors, omissions, or hallucinations.

### Information Extraction / ID 2 / Score 5

**Question**

```
On August 15, 1969, what was the name of the four-and-a-half-year-old boy that his mother was holding, as the family stepped off the bus and began walking?
```

**Model Answer**

```
On August 15, 1969, the name of the four-and-a-half-year-old boy that his mother was holding as the family stepped off the bus and began walking was Henrik Inge.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly identifies the boy's name as Henrik Inge, matching the reference answer exactly. There are no spelling errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the entity name or factual detail.

### Adversarial Abstention / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
What specific model of television did the narrator turn on for their grandparents on July 24, 1975?
```

**Model Answer**

```
我不记得你告诉过我这些具体信息，关于电视的型号。记录中没有提到电视的型号。
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly states that the specific information about the television model is not mentioned or remembered, aligning with the reference answer which indicates the information is insufficient or not known. There are no factual errors, hallucinations, or omissions regarding entities or details, as both answers agree on the lack of specific data.

### Adversarial Abstention / ID 1 / Score 5

**Question**

```
In August 1969, what specific brand was the two boxes that my father was carrying in his hand when he got off the bus?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The record excerpt doesn't mention any specific brand for the boxes your father was carrying. It only describes him carrying two suitcases when he got off the bus. I don't have enough information to tell you what brand they were.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly states that the specific brand is not mentioned, aligning with the reference answer's indication of insufficient information. No entities are incorrectly named or hallucinated, and the response accurately reflects the lack of detail in the record.

### Mind-Body Interaction / ID 3 / Score 4

**Question**

```
The narrator engages in a dialogue with Henrik Inge about fear. How does the external verbal exchange serve as a mechanism to regulate the narrator's internal physiological and emotional state?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The dialogue with Henrik Inge serves as a mechanism to help the narrator regulate their internal emotional state. When Henrik taunts the narrator by saying he's a fox and tries to catch them, it triggers fear. The narrator shouts back, "No, you're not a fox," indicating resistance to Henrik's aggressive play. Then, the narrator asks Henrik if he's scared, trying to shift the dynamic from fear to a more neutral stance. This shifts Henrik's response to one of reassurance: "No, why should I be scared? There's nothing to be afraid of here." This exchange helps the narrator calm down and feel safer, as Henrik’s words validate that there's no real threat present.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: The model answer correctly constructs the mapping from external verbal exchange to internal emotional regulation, showing how the dialogue helps the narrator calm down and feel safer. Step 2: However, it misses the specific core metaphorical keywords from the Reference Answer: 'external anchor' and the direct cause-effect phrasing 'directly causing his internal agitation (heart) to settle down'. The model uses more generic terms like 'shifts the dynamic' and 'validates that there's no real threat', which capture the correct meaning but lack the precise metaphorical depth. Step 3: The answer is accurate and covers both action and psychology layers, but does not fully capture the specific literary imagery or concise metaphorical language of the Reference, placing it at a 4

**Question**

```
In the description of the sewer workers, the narrator meticulously tracks the physical disappearance of their body parts ('feet... thighs... stomach...'). How does this segmented physical observation drive the narrator's internal speculation about the nature of the subterranean space?
```

**Model Answer**

```
In the description where the narrator watches the sewer workers disappear into the storm drain opening, the segmented physical observation of their body parts ('feet... thighs... stomach...') drives a sense of curiosity and mystery about what lies beneath. This detailed observation heightens the narrator's fascination and wonder, leading to internal questions about the nature of the subterranean space. The narrator is left wondering what exactly exists down there, suggesting it might be some kind of tunnel or unknown area that piques their imagination, making it seem both intriguing and slightly fearful.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: The model answer correctly constructs the mapping from external action to internal psychology. It identifies the segmented physical observation as driving curiosity and mystery, leading to internal questions about the subterranean space. Step 2: The model captures the correct meaning but misses the specific metaphorical keywords or depth found in the Reference Answer. The Reference uses terms like 'physical driver,' 'fill the void,' and 'mapping the transition from the visible surface world to the mysterious underground,' which are more precise and metaphorical. The model uses more generic terms like 'fascination and wonder,' 'intriguing and slightly fearful,' without the specific imagery of filling a void or mapping a transition. Step 3: The answer is accurate and covers

### Expert-Annotated Psychoanalysis / ID 3 / Score 4

**Question**

```
How does "I" define something as "correct"?
```

**Model Answer**

```
From the given records, "I" defines something as "correct" when it aligns with a standard or rule that is recognized or taught. For instance, in record_id 330, "I" defined roll call correctly based on the teacher's instructions and received affirmation from the teacher for doing so. This suggests "I" considers something correct when it matches the expected or taught response.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: Check for 'External->Internal' mapping. The model answer successfully constructs a mapping from external action (e.g., roll call based on teacher's instructions) to internal psychology (aligning with recognized standards, matching expected responses). Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords. The reference answer uses the core concepts of 'established rules' and 'avoiding subsequent trouble,' which are more abstract and metaphorical in a psychological sense (rules as internalized structures, trouble as consequence). The model answer captures 'aligns with a standard or rule that is recognized or taught' and 'matches the expected or taught response,' which accurately reflects the meaning but misses the specific metaphorical depth of 'will not cause subsequent trou

### Expert-Annotated Psychoanalysis / ID 1 / Score 4

**Question**

```
What does "I" prioritize most when making decisions?
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the records, "I" prioritize pleasing or avoiding punishment from my father. This is evident from instances where I attempt to do things correctly according to his expectations, such as in record_id 292 when I follow his command and pack swimsuits for Hvasser, and record_id 299 where I try to stay neat and tidy despite the poor weather conditions at the lake, likely to avoid criticism. Additionally, the concern about not wanting to be locked in my room again (record_id 288) shows a fear of punishment which influences decision-making.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: The model answer successfully constructs an 'External Trigger -> Internal Mapping' logic loop by citing specific actions (following commands, staying neat, concern about being locked) and linking them to internal motivations (pleasing father, avoiding punishment, fear of criticism). Step 2: The reference answer's core concept is 'avoiding potential risks and penalties.' The model answer captures the correct meaning with keywords like 'avoiding punishment,' 'fear of punishment,' and 'avoid criticism,' but it does not use the exact phrase 'avoiding potential risks' or the term 'penalties' from the reference. Instead, it uses more specific, father-related terms. Step 3: The model answer is accurate and shows depth by connecting actions to psychological motivations, but it sl

**Question**

```
What are the bottom lines that "I" would rather endure losses to never cross?
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the records provided, "I" would rather endure losses than cross the forbidden areas that "I" was warned about, specifically the main road and the lakeside. These places were emphasized as dangerous, with the main road posing a threat from traffic and the lakeside being a place where children were strictly told never to go alone due to the risk of drowning. 

Evidence:
- [id 82]: "I knew the first forbidden area was the main road from the bridge all the way to the gas station."
- [id 83]: "I heard adults emphasize: 'Never go to the lake alone!'"
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: Check for 'External->Internal' mapping. The model answer only describes external forbidden areas (main road, lakeside) and the warnings about them, without explaining the internal psychology, thoughts, or motivations behind why 'I' would rather endure losses than cross them. It misses the internal dimension entirely. Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords. The reference answer mentions 'publicly challenging or questioning the father's authority,' which is a specific psychological and relational concept. The model answer does not capture this metaphor or any equivalent depth; it stays at a literal, safety-rule level. Step 3: Compare depth with Reference and conclude score. The model answer retells external events and warnings without linking them to internal ps

The narrator observes the telecom engineer climbing the pole with apparent ease. However, his internal cognition classifies the climber's movements as 'extremely complex and incomprehensible.' How does this cognitive dissonance between the observer's internal logic and the external reality elevate the worker's physical action to a realm of 'magic'?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
The narrator's internal inability to process the mechanics of the climb ('complex and incomprehensible') contrasts sharply with the worker's external 'slow, sure' and effortless ('no stress') movements. This gap between the observer's mental difficulty and the actor's physical ease creates a sense of awe, framing the shoes and the action as 'magical' and 'impossible' within the narrator's logic.

**Question**

The narrative is set in 1969 as the family moves to a new home in Tromøy. However, the text displaces the narrator's consciousness back to 1964. What specific housing transition anchors this comparison between their current life and the past five years?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
The transition from renting an apartment on Thereses Street in Berlunn (Oslo) to building and moving into their own house in Tromøy.
```

**Model Answer**

```
The narrative excerpt doesn't mention a specific housing transition in 1964. It does, however, detail the family's move from Bærum to their new home in 1969 and mentions they had lived in Bærum for five years prior. The comparison between their current life and the past is drawn from their move from Bærum, where they lived for five years, to their new home being built in Tromøy. There isn't a direct mention of a 1964 housing transition in the text provided.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: The model answer states there is no specific housing transition mentioned in 1964, and instead refers to a move from Bærum. Compare with Ref: The reference answer specifies a transition from renting an apartment on Thereses Street in Berlunn (Oslo) to building and moving into their own house in Tromøy. Verdict: The model answer does not provide the correct specific housing transition, and the numerical value (1964 as the anchor point) is not addressed correctly, resulting in a complete mismatch.

```

**Reference Answer**

```
The father's night shifts while studying English/Levinvik and the mother's attendance at Ullevål Nursing College.
```

**Model Answer**

```
The record excerpt mentions the parents' professional roles and their life in Bærum, not Berlunn (Oslo). According to the information provided, the father studied English and Leivik during the day and worked night shifts, while the mother attended nursing school at Ullenvold Hospital. They both secured their careers: he as a teacher and she as a nurse at a care facility. The struggle described isn't anchored in Berlunn but rather in Bærum, where they faced balancing education with work—studying during the day and working at night. There's no mention of a specific struggle in Berlunn related to their educational and occupational roles.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: The model answer does not provide any specific numerical values, dates, times, durations, or frequencies. It discusses locations (Bærum vs. Berlunn/Oslo), professional roles (teacher, nurse), and general struggles (balancing education with work), but no numbers. Compare with Ref: The reference answer also contains no numerical values; it mentions 'night shifts' and 'mid-60s' contextually but without specific numbers. Since the task is to evaluate numerical values and none are present in either answer, the model fails to provide any numerical information, making it incorrect for this numerical comparison task.

**Model Answer**

Based on the record from August 15, 1969, the bus arrived and the family stepped out at around 14:01. They walked along the path, and the father unlocked and entered the Red House at approximately 14:11. Therefore, it took about 10 minutes for the bus to depart and finally for them to arrive outside their new home.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: 10 minutes. Compare with Ref: 8 minutes 40 seconds. Verdict: The model's value of 10 minutes does not match the reference answer of 8 minutes 40 seconds. The difference is more than a minor formatting difference or reasonable error; it is a distinct numerical discrepancy. The model's answer is based on inferred times (14:01 to 14:11) leading to 10 minutes, but the reference specifies 8 minutes 40 seconds, which is not within a reasonable range for a fuzzy match given the context. Therefore, it is incorrect.

From the time the grandparents entered the living room to watch television until the television broke, it took 1 minute 10 seconds according to the record from July 24, 1975. 

The specific timestamps are:
- Grandfather enters happily to watch TV: 1975-07-24 15:31:00
- The TV breaks: 1975-07-24 15:32:10

So the duration is exactly 1 minute 10 seconds.

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: 1 minute 10 seconds. Compare with Ref: 2 minutes 10 seconds. The model answer is completely wrong as it does not match the reference answer. The duration difference is significant (1 minute vs 2 minutes), and there is no reasonable error range that would justify a fuzzy match. Therefore, the score is 0.

According to the record from the early morning of July 25, 1975, how long did it take from when "I" was awakened to when I saw the cat chasing the mouse and eventually the mouse escaping?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
12 minutes 10 seconds
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the provided record excerpt, it took 10 minutes 40 seconds from when you were awakened to when you saw the cat chasing the mouse and eventually the mouse escaping.

Here's how the timing is calculated:

- You woke up at 02:10:00.
- The sequence of events related to the cat chasing the mouse, starting with "I saw the cat leap onto the stone courtyard wall and walk toward the sundial ball on the pillar at the end of the wall" (record id 270), occurs at 02:20:00.
  
The difference between 02:20:00 and 02:10:00 is exactly 10 minutes. If we also consider that you first noticed sounds and movements by your window before seeing the cat, the detailed observation of the cat catching and playing with the mouse adds a bit more time, but it's not specified to a specific second in the records. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that from your initial wake-up moment until you observed these events, it was around 10 minutes plus some additional seconds (up to about 40 seconds as suggested by context), making it a total of approximately 10 minutes 40 seconds.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: 10 minutes 40 seconds. Compare with Ref: 12 minutes 10 seconds. The model's value is not an exact match and does not fall within a reasonable range given the context; it is a completely different duration. Therefore, it is incorrect.

- Temporal Reasoning
  - 将时间线显式化：先列出涉及的日期/时间点，再做推理与比较
  - 检索时扩大时间窗口：避免只取单日导致跨日线索丢失
  - 增加自检：输出前对比记录摘录中的实体/时间/地点是否一致
