### Temporal Reasoning / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
According to the record from the early morning of July 25, 1975, how long did it take from when "I" was awakened to when I saw the cat chasing the mouse and eventually the mouse escaping?
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the timestamps provided, you were awakened at 02:10:00 and saw the cat chasing the mouse, with the mouse eventually escaping around 02:22:10. Therefore, it took 12 minutes and 10 seconds from when you were awakened until you saw the mouse slip successfully beneath the asbestos cement board just before the cat rushed forward.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: 12 minutes and 10 seconds. Compare with Ref: 12 minutes 10 seconds. Verdict: The numerical values match exactly, with only minor formatting differences in phrasing (e.g., 'and' vs no conjunction), which is allowed under the scoring criteria for an exact match.

### Temporal Reasoning / ID 1 / Score 5

**Question**

```
According to the record from August 15, 1969, how long did it take for the bus carrying the family to depart and finally arrive outside the Red House?
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the provided record excerpt, it took 8 minutes 40 seconds from when the bus first came into view until it stopped outside the Red House. The duration is calculated from timestamp 14:00:00 to 14:08:40.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: 8 minutes 40 seconds. Compare with Ref: 8 minutes 40 seconds. Verdict: Exact match.

### Mnestic Trigger Analysis / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
The narrator is physically in 1969 but mentally reconstructing the parents' wedding in the early 60s. What specific visual detail from the wedding serves as an anchor to reveal the father's social isolation?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The specific visual detail from the wedding that serves as an anchor to reveal the father's social isolation is his smile surrounded by solitude, particularly noted in the photo. The narrator mentions, "Looking at the photo, at his smile surrounded by solitude, I realize he didn't fully belong to her social circle." This image highlights the father's feeling of being an outsider at the wedding.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: The wedding photos where the father is smiling but appears surrounded by loneliness, lacking his own family's presence. Compare with Ref: The wedding photos where the father is smiling but appears surrounded by loneliness, lacking his own family's presence. Verdict: The model answer accurately captures the specific visual detail from the wedding that reveals the father's social isolation, matching the reference answer exactly in terms of the described visual detail, despite minor phrasing differences.

### Information Extraction / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
On August 15, 1969, as the narrator’s family walked along a gravel road, what building did they see on their right?
```

**Model Answer**

```
On August 15, 1969, as the narrator’s family walked along a gravel road, they saw a newly built house standing to their right.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly identifies the building as 'a newly built house', which matches the reference answer exactly. There are no errors in entity names, factual details, or completeness. The answer is fully accurate and contains all necessary information.

### Information Extraction / ID 2 / Score 5

**Question**

```
On August 15, 1969, what was the name of the four-and-a-half-year-old boy that his mother was holding, as the family stepped off the bus and began walking?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The four-and-a-half-year-old boy was named Henrik Inge.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly identifies the boy's name as Henrik Inge, which matches the reference answer exactly. There are no spelling errors, omissions, or inaccuracies. The entity name is accurate, and the factual detail is complete.

### Information Extraction / ID 1 / Score 5

**Question**

```
On August 15, 1969, which shipping company's bus did the narrator's family take?
```

**Model Answer**

```
On August 15, 1969, the narrator's family took a bus belonging to the Aucity Shipping Company.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly identifies the shipping company as Aucity Shipping Company, matching the reference answer exactly. No errors in entity names or factual details are present.

### Adversarial Abstention / ID 3 / Score 5

**Question**

```
What specific model of television did the narrator turn on for their grandparents on July 24, 1975?
```

**Model Answer**

```
我不记得你告诉过我这些。根据记录，没有提到电视的具体型号。只知道电视被打开了，然后出故障了。
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly states that the specific model of television is not mentioned in the available information, aligning with the reference answer which indicates the information is insufficient. There are no factual errors, hallucinations, or omissions regarding entities or details.

### Adversarial Abstention / ID 1 / Score 5

**Question**

```
In August 1969, what specific brand was the two boxes that my father was carrying in his hand when he got off the bus?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The record excerpt doesn't mention any specific brand for the boxes your father was carrying. It only describes two suitcases, but there's no information about the brand.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

The model answer correctly states that the record excerpt does not mention any specific brand for the boxes, aligning with the reference answer's indication of insufficient information. Both answers convey the same factual conclusion: no brand is specified. There are no errors in entity names or factual details.

### Mind-Body Interaction / ID 2 / Score 4

**Question**

```
In the description of the sewer workers, the narrator meticulously tracks the physical disappearance of their body parts ('feet... thighs... stomach...'). How does this segmented physical observation drive the narrator's internal speculation about the nature of the subterranean space?
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the description, the narrator's segmented observation of the sewer workers disappearing into the storm drain opening – starting from their feet and ending with their heads vanishing – creates a sense of intrigue and curiosity about what lies beneath. This methodical tracking of body parts makes the descent seem like a mysterious journey into an unknown space. It fuels the narrator’s internal speculation that the tunnel below might be extensive and complex, perhaps even labyrinthine. The narrator wonders silently about what exactly is down there, suggesting it could be a vast network or tunnel system, adding to the sense of mystery and wonder surrounding this underground world.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: Check for 'External->Internal' mapping. The model answer correctly identifies the external trigger (segmented observation of body parts disappearing) and maps it to the internal psychological effect (intrigue, curiosity, speculation about the underground space). It covers both action and psychology layers. Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords. The reference answer uses core metaphorical concepts like 'physical driver,' 'fill the void,' and 'mapping the transition from the visible surface world to the mysterious underground.' The model answer captures the meaning (mysterious journey, unknown space, vast network) but misses the specific metaphorical phrasing of 'filling the void' or the explicit transition mapping. It uses 'labyrinthine' which adds depth but i

### Mind-Body Interaction / ID 1 / Score 4

**Question**

```
The narrator observes the telecom engineer climbing the pole with apparent ease. However, his internal cognition classifies the climber's movements as 'extremely complex and incomprehensible.' How does this cognitive dissonance between the observer's internal logic and the external reality elevate the worker's physical action to a realm of 'magic'?
```

**Model Answer**

```
The narrator finds the telecom engineer's ability to climb the pole with such ease and confidence as something that goes beyond their understanding, making it seem like a form of magic. This is because from the observer's perspective, the complex physical skills and the apparent effortlessness of the task create a gap between what they know and what they see. The climber's movements, which look simple and natural to him, are perceived as mysterious and almost magical by the young observer who lacks the context or experience to fully comprehend the process. This cognitive dissonance elevates the act of climbing to a realm of wonder, where something ordinary becomes extraordinary due to its unfamiliarity and perceived difficulty.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: The model answer correctly constructs the mapping from external action (climbing with ease) to internal psychology (narrator's cognitive dissonance, perception of magic). Step 2: The model captures the core meaning of the cognitive gap and the elevation to 'magic', but misses the specific metaphorical keywords from the Reference Answer such as 'slow, sure', 'no stress', and the explicit contrast between 'mental difficulty' and 'physical ease'. The model uses 'complex physical skills', 'effortlessness', and 'mysterious', which are accurate but not the exact terms from the reference. Step 3: The answer is accurate and covers both layers, but lacks the precise literary imagery and specific phrasing of the reference, placing it at a 4 (Good - Accurate but Literal).

**Question**

```
What does "I" prioritize most when making decisions?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
Avoiding potential risks and penalties.
```

**Model Answer**

```
我不记得你告诉过我关于"I"在做决定时最优先考虑的是什么。要回答这个问题，我需要更多关于这位人物的决策模式或价值观的信息。你可以分享一些具体例子吗？
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: Check for 'External->Internal' mapping. The model answer does not provide any analysis of external actions or internal psychology; it states it lacks information and requests more details. Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords. The model answer does not mention any keywords or metaphors, as it does not attempt an analysis. Step 3: Compare depth with Reference and conclude score. The reference answer specifies 'Avoiding potential risks and penalties,' but the model answer fails to address the question at all, showing no mapping or insight. Therefore, it scores 0 for being irrelevant to the task of analysis.

What are the bottom lines that "I" would rather endure losses to never cross?

**Model Answer**

```
我不记得你告诉过我这些具体的信息。不过，如果你愿意分享一些细节，我可以更好地理解你提到的"你"在面对选择时坚守的原则是什么。
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Step 1: Check for 'External->Internal' mapping. The model answer does not address the user's question about the character's bottom lines or internal psychology; it instead states it does not recall information and asks for details, showing no construction of external action to internal psychology mapping. Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords. The model answer misses the core metaphorical concept of 'publicly challenging or questioning the father's authority' entirely. Step 3: Compare depth with Reference and conclude score. The model answer is completely irrelevant to the reference answer, failing to provide any analysis or insight, thus scoring 0.

Step 1: Check for 'External->Internal' mapping. The model answer does not address the user's question about how 'I' defines something as 'correct'. Instead, it states it doesn't remember and asks for clarification or clues from the conversation. There is no construction of external action to internal psychology mapping because the model does not provide an analysis or answer related to the query. Step 2: Check for specific core metaphors/keywords. The reference answer mentions 'established rules' and 'subsequent trouble', but the model answer does not engage with these concepts at all. It fails to capture any metaphorical meaning or keywords. Step 3: Compare depth with Reference and conclude score. The model answer is completely irrelevant to the user's question and the reference

**Question**

The narrative is set in 1969 as the family moves to a new home in Tromøy. However, the text displaces the narrator's consciousness back to 1964. What specific housing transition anchors this comparison between their current life and the past five years?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
The transition from renting an apartment on Thereses Street in Berlunn (Oslo) to building and moving into their own house in Tromøy.
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the record excerpt, the family had been living in Bærum for five years before moving to their new home in 1969. They were renting an old house outside the former Høver barracks during this interim period. This transition from their previous home in Bærum to the new location in Tromøy highlights the changes in their living situation and marks a significant shift in their lives. The move represents a step forward as they look towards a new beginning in their new home.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: Bærum. Compare with Ref: Thereses Street in Berlunn (Oslo). Verdict: The model answer incorrectly states the family was living in Bærum for five years before moving, while the reference answer specifies renting an apartment on Thereses Street in Berlunn (Oslo). The location and housing type do not match, and no numerical values (years, durations) are provided in the model answer to compare with the reference's implied timeline. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Question**

```
In 1969, the narrator outlines the parents' professional roles in Tromøy. What specific educational and occupational struggle anchors the memory of their previous life in Berlunn (Oslo) during the mid-60s?
```

**Reference Answer**

```
The father's night shifts while studying English/Levinvik and the mother's attendance at Ullevål Nursing College.
```

**Model Answer**

```
Based on the excerpt, I can share that in 1969, the parents had specific roles: the father was a teacher and the mother was a nurse. However, regarding their life in Bærum (not Berlunn as mentioned), during the mid-60s, it is noted that he studied English and Leivik while working night shifts. Simultaneously, she attended nursing school at Ullenvold Hospital. There isn't a specific struggle described related to their educational or occupational life in Bærum during the mid-60s, but the implication of balancing studies and work suggests a challenging period for them.
```

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: The father studied English and Leivik while working night shifts; the mother attended nursing school at Ullenvold Hospital. Compare with Ref: The father's night shifts while studying English/Levinvik and the mother's attendance at Ullevål Nursing College. Verdict: The model answer incorrectly states the location as Bærum instead of Berlunn (Oslo) and Ullenvold Hospital instead of Ullevål Nursing College, and introduces 'Leivik' which may be a misspelling of 'Levinvik'. The core numerical/date values (mid-60s, night shifts) are present but the specific educational institutions and location are wrong, which are key details in the reference answer. Since the question asks for specific educational and occupational struggle anchoring the memory, and the model gets

**Model Answer**

Based on the timestamps provided in the record excerpt, it took 1 minute 10 seconds from when the grandparents entered the living room to watch television until the television broke. The duration from when "It's on." (indicating the TV was turned on and presumably started playing) at 15:31:20 to when "It's broken." was stated with the screen going black at 15:32:10.

**Judge Reasoning**

Extract model value: 1 minute 10 seconds. Compare with Ref: 2 minutes 10 seconds. The model answer is completely wrong as it does not match the reference answer. The difference is not minor; it's a full minute off, which is a significant error in this context. No reasonable range or fuzzy match applies here since the reference is precise and the model's answer is distinctly different.

The text does not mention / the information is insufficient / I don't know.

Based on the given information, it's mentioned that Trude had loosened its collar because she was wearing high heels. This allowed the dog to bite the narrator’s arm despite being leashed.

**Judge Reasoning**

The Model Answer invents a character 'Trude' and a detail about loosening a collar due to high heels, which are not present in the Reference Answer. The Reference Answer explicitly states that the text does not mention or has insufficient information, indicating that the Model Answer is a hallucination. This fits the 'Bad - Hallucination' category (score 1) as it invents characters and details that do not exist.

### 分任务可执行改进
- Adversarial Abstention
  - 加入“可回答性检查”：若记录无证据或题干诱导，优先明确拒答/说明缺失信息
  - 对含糊问题输出结构化澄清：列出需要的缺失字段并给出无法判断的原因
  - 加强“证据优先”约束：没有记录证据就不写
- Expert-Annotated Psychoanalysis
  - 分层解释：行为表象→动机假设→记录证据→不确定性声明
  - 降低臆测：遇到证据不足时给出多种可能并标注置信度
- Information Extraction
  - 强化实体对齐：回答前先抽取题干中的实体名/属性并逐项对照记录
  - 减少“合理补充”：除非有证据，否则不要追加背景细节
- Logical Event Ordering
  - 输出排序依据：每个事件给出同一维度的评分理由（风险/因果/紧急程度）
  - 避免混用维度：明确是按“危险性/时间先后/重要性”哪一种排序
  - 加强“证据优先”约束：没有记录证据就不写
  - 增加自检：输出前对比记录摘录中的实体/时间/地点是否一致
- Mind-Body Interaction
  - 先复述冲突点（心理 vs 生理）再解释机制，避免直接下结论
  - 回答保持可证据化：不引入未在记录出现的病史/诊断
- Mnestic Trigger Analysis
  - 把触发线索与回忆内容一一对应：线索→被激活的记忆片段→理由
  - 减少泛化心理分析：优先使用记录中的具体线索词/地点/物品
  - 增加自检：输出前对比记录摘录中的实体/时间/地点是否一致
- Temporal Reasoning
  - 将时间线显式化：先列出涉及的日期/时间点，再做推理与比较
  - 检索时扩大时间窗口：避免只取单日导致跨日线索丢失
  - 增加自检：输出前对比记录摘录中的实体/时间/地点是否一致
